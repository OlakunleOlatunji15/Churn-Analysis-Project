## Problem Statement

This analysis aims to help the bank understand its customer churn rates and identify factors contributing to customer churn. By analyzing data from France, Spain, and Germany, the bank can make informed decisions to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

### Key Insights:
- The overall churn rate stands at **20.4%**, with the target being **15%**.
- Significant factors contributing to churn include:
  - **Age groups:** Customers aged **51-60** have the highest churn rate.
  - **Credit scores:** Low credit scores (<400) are associated with a **100% churn rate**.
  - **Account balances:** Customers with high account balances (>200k) have the highest churn rate (**55.9%**).

By targeting these areas, the bank can work toward reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported the dataset (CSV format) into **Power BI Desktop**.

### 2. Data Preview
- Used Power Query Editor to examine the dataset by enabling:
  - **Column Distribution**
  - **Column Quality**
  - **Column Profile**

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., **Estimated Salary**).
- Renamed products to "Prod 1," "Prod 2," etc., using the **Add Column by Example** feature.

- Grouped numerical columns (e.g., Age, Credit Score, Account Balance) into ranges.
- Ranked grouped columns using a reference and calculated column for sorting.

### 4. Data Modeling
- Established relationships between tables in the data model.

### 5. Measure Creation
- **Total Customers:**  
  Customers = COUNT('Customer Data'[Customer ID])
